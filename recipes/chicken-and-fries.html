    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a one pan meal that's in the oven in 15 minutes. Rosemary, garlic, and oregano create a mouth watering aroma. If using dried herbs in place of fresh, use 1/3 the amount. Potatoes are crispy like french fries, just serve with ketchup. Kids just love this!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>6 small red potatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken and potatoes into a large bowl. Pour olive oil over them, and stir to coat. Scatter the chicken and potato pieces in a large baking dish, or cookie sheet with sides. Sprinkle with rosemary, oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, uncovered. Baste during the last 15 minutes for extra crispness.</li>
